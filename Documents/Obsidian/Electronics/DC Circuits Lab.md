Tidbits
- "Short circuit current"
	- Connect the output to ground while making the current flow through your current meter
	- Shorting refers to creating a path of little to no resistance between two points
		- Usually results in an amount of current the circuit is not designed to handle to flow
	- This will rarely be put into practice again
		- Too brutal in the lab
			- Can be too large for the health of one's circuit (could blow)
		- Too slow when you want to calculate R_Thevenin on paper
- Analog current/volt-meter uses the needle's proportionality to the torque developed by a coil that sits in the field of a permanent magnet, which itself is proportional to the current through the coil

Worked-Through Tips
- Negligible resistance differences should be ignored (strive for 250k instead of 250.000012342134k)
- Negligible current differences should be considered (small current differences lead to series resistor valuation differences)
- Wider cables lead to reduced current
	- Converse applies
